FRONTEND IMPROVEMENTS

#LANDING PAGE.js with adding LandingPage.css

Key Styling Features:
Gradient Background: The jumbotron has a gradient background to make it more visually appealing (linear-gradient(135deg, #6a11cb 0%, #2575fc 100%)).
Typography: Increased font size for the headings and paragraphs to make the text more readable and attractive.
Buttons: Stylish primary (Sign Up) and secondary (Log In) buttons with rounded corners and a hover effect to enhance user interaction.
Container Alignment: The content is centered both horizontally and vertically using Flexbox, ensuring the page looks great on any screen size.
Shadows and Spacing: Box shadows for the jumbotron and proper padding/margins create a clean and modern feel.

#NAVBAR.JS with adding Navbar.css

Key Styling Features:
Navbar Background: I added a gradient background to the navbar (#6a11cb to make it visually appealing and modern).
Typography:
The brand's name RealTool now uses uppercase, bold, and slightly spaced letters for a cleaner look.
I increased the font size and added padding to the navigation links for a more polished feel.
Link Hover Effect: Links change color to a soft yellow (#ffdd57) and underline when hovered over to improve interactivity.
Logout Button Styling: The logout button is styled with a custom class, using the same color theme and a hover effect that makes it stand out. It also shows the username before the logout option.
Mobile Responsiveness:
The navbar is fully responsive with a hamburger-style menu on smaller screens (below 768px).
The font size and padding adjust automatically on smaller screens for a better mobile experience.
Button Appearance: The logout button doesn't look like a traditional button, but it's styled as a link with an additional hover effect for better user experience.

#LOGIN.JS with adding Login.css

Key Styling Features:
Centered Form: The login form is centered both vertically and horizontally, ensuring a clean and modern layout.
Form Background and Box Shadows: The form has a white background with a subtle shadow for a sleek, card-like appearance.
Responsive Input Fields: The input fields are styled with padding, a soft border, and a focus effect that changes the border color to a blue shade (#6a11cb).
Buttons: The login button is full-width (btn-block), with a gradient background color that transitions when hovered (#6a11cb to #2575fc), making it stand out.
Error Message: Error messages are displayed below the form, with red text (#d9534f) to grab attention.
Register Link: The register link is styled with a blue color (#6a11cb), and it changes to an underline when hovered for better user interaction.
Mobile Responsiveness: The form adjusts its padding and font sizes on smaller screens (below 576px), making it more user-friendly on mobile devices.

#DASHBOARD.JS with adding DASHBOARD.css

Key Styling Improvements:
Grid Layout for Cards: The document cards are now displayed in a responsive grid layout using grid-template-columns, which adapts to the screen size. This allows the cards to adjust in number per row based on the screen width.
Card Interactivity: Cards have a hover effect, where they lift slightly and gain a stronger shadow. This makes the UI feel more interactive.
Button Styling: Both the "Open Document" and "Create New Document" buttons are styled with modern colors and hover effects to improve user engagement.
Typography: Clear and readable typography has been applied, with different font sizes for titles, dates, and buttons. Consistency is maintained across the dashboard.
Mobile Responsiveness: The layout adapts well to smaller screen sizes (e.g., tablets and mobile devices). The grid layout ensures that the cards are still neatly aligned, and the buttons remain easy to click on smaller screens.

#DOCUMENTDETAILS.JS with DocumentDetails.css

Key Styling Enhancements:
Card Layout and Container: The document details are displayed inside a well-designed card with a subtle box shadow and rounded corners. This helps improve the readability of the document details page.
Form Inputs: The title and content inputs are styled with larger padding and a focus effect to make them more interactive. The inputs change border color when focused, providing visual feedback to users.
Buttons: The "Update Document" and "Delete Document" buttons are styled with bold colors, padding, and hover effects for interactivity. They also slightly lift (using transform: translateY) when hovered over to give a sense of depth.
Alert and Loading States: The success and error messages are prominently displayed in styled alert boxes with a consistent color scheme. The loading state is also styled with a distinct font and centered text.
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts well on smaller screens by decreasing font sizes and adjusting padding for better readability on mobile devices.

#DOCUMENTFORM.JS with DocumentForm.css

Key Styling Improvements:
Container Design: The form is now inside a clean container with padding, border radius, and a subtle shadow effect to create a modern "card-like" feel.
Title Styling: The title of the form is prominent, with increased font size and boldness, making it easy for users to understand the purpose of the form.
Form Input Fields: The input and textarea fields have smooth borders, padding, and a focus effect that changes the border color to enhance the interactivity and make them visually appealing.
Buttons: The submit button is styled to be more prominent, with rounded corners, background color transitions on hover, and slight elevation (transform effect) to give the impression of a clickable element.
Responsiveness: The design is responsive, adjusting the padding, font size, and button size on smaller screens, ensuring that the form remains user-friendly on mobile devices.
Consistency: The colors and spacing are consistent throughout the form, maintaining a clean and professional look.
